# OSM Scout Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rinigus/osmscout-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rinigus/osmscout-server)

OSM Scout server can be used as a drop-in replacement for online map
services providing map tiles, search, and routing. As a result, an
offline operation is possible if the device has a server and map
client programs installed and running.

Among other services, the server can be used to provide:
* vector or raster tiles for other applications;
* search for locations and free text search;
* search for POIs next to a reference point or route;
* calculating routes between given sequence of points;

User's guide is available at https://rinigus.github.io/osmscout-server .

The server supports:
* map rendering via Mapnik (https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik);
* hosting of Mapbox GL vector tiles (https://github.com/mapbox/awesome-vector-tiles);
* search via Geocoder-NLP (https://github.com/rinigus/geocoder-nlp) which is based on libpostal (https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal);
* routing instructions via Valhalla (https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla);
* map rendering, search, and routing via libosmscout (http://libosmscout.sourceforge.net/).

To use the server, you have to start it and configure the client to
access it. An example configurations for Poor Maps, modRana, and
JavaScript-based clients are provided under "example" folder. At
present, WhoGo Maps, Poor Maps and modRana include plugins already in
the upstream and no additional configuration is needed.

The server is written using Qt. The server can be used as a console, a
Sailfish, Kirigami, or a QtQuick application. Installation
instructions are given in [INSTALL](INSTALL.md).


## Maps

Starting from version 0.7, the server uses maps distributed via online
distribution network. It is expected that the users would download,
update, and, when needed, remove maps via server's GUI/CLI. This
distribution model allows users to specify which components are
required (libosmscout, geocoder-nlp, for example) and download only
the required components.

If tinkering is required, it is still possible to import the maps
manually. However, in this case, the user is expected to incorporate
the manually imported maps into configuration JSON file describing
that map and use specific developer options.


### Maps distribution and data

Maps are hosted by Natural Language Processing Centre
(https://nlp.fi.muni.cz/en/ , Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk
University, Brno, Czech Republic) through modRana (http://modrana.org)
data repository.

Map data from OpenStreetMap, Open Database License 1.0. Maps are
converted to a suitable format from downloaded extracts and/or using
polygons as provided by Geofabrik GmbH.

UK postal codes downloaded from https://www.freemaptools.com. These
data contain: Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database
right 2017; Royal Mail data © Royal Mail copyright and database right
2017; National Statistics data © Crown copyright and database right
2017.


## Settings

Configuration settings are in
~/.config/osmscout-server/osmscout-server.conf and this file is
initialized on the first start. For Sailfish version, add prefix
harbour- to the file and directory name.

In configuration file you can specify server HTTP port and the
interface. In addition, map directory with several rendering options
are configured. In Sailfish, map rendering options are possible to
specify through GUI.

Starting from version 0.3.0, server supports up to 100
connections. The requests are processed in parallel, as much as
possible, with the number of parallel threads the same as the number
of CPUs. Depending on the used backend, one operation can block other
operations due to the blocking of the corresponding
database. Exceeding the number of supported connections would lead to
dropping the connections exceeding the limit.


## General notes for developers

There are several aspects that became evident while developing and
using OSM Scout Server for providing offline solution on a mobile
platform, such as Sailfish OS.

### Request large tiles

When requesting rendered map tiles, its advantageous to request larger
tiles. Each tile is rendered with an overhead that is induced by
labels located close to the borders. For example, current default
settings in Mapnik backend, add 128 pixels on each side of the
tile. This buffer is internally multiplied by the scale of Mapnik map,
commonly set to 3. So, we have 384 pixels added on each side. If the
common size of the tiles is requested (256x256), each tile triggers
rendering of 1024x1024 out of which only 256x256 section is used. In
other words, we use only 6.25% of the rendered data. By requesting
tiles with the size 1024x1024, we bring up efficiency to 32.7%, a
significant increase.

### Do not use timeouts

When using the server on mobile, one has to remember that the server
is not rendering tiles nor performing any other calculations while the
device is asleep. The server is not keeping device awake, its a job of
a client that interacts with the user and knows whether current
operation is time-critical, as during navigation, or can be postponed,
as when user is just browsing a map and switched off the phone. As a
result, using timeouts while interacting with the server is strongly
discouraged. In particular, when using timeouts and the device was put
to sleep, this can cause large number of re-submissions by a client
leading to failure of the server to process a long accumulated queue
of requests in reasonable time. So, its recommended not to use any
timeouts when using server on the device that can be put to sleep or,
if the timeouts are needed, not to submit new requests after
that. Since, when client and the server are operating on the same
device, network failure is not expected, such timeouts are, in
general, not needed.

## Access

Server provides its functionality via HTTP or D-Bus. APIs on HTTP and
D-Bus cover different functionality. HTTP has been available from the
beginning and D-Bus has been added starting from version 1.9. Below,
HTTP API is described, followed by [D-Bus API](#d-bus-api), when
stated.


## Default port

Default port for HTTP access is 8553 TCP and the server binds to
127.0.0.1 providing services to local apps only. Binding and the port
can be changed in the configuration file manually.


## URL schema

Server provides access via GET and POST methods. Access to
functionality is provided via path and query parts of URL. The path
determines the module that is accessed with the query specifying
arguments. Here, order of query elements is not important.

When using GET, set the query parameters after `?` in the form
`variable=value` and separate the parameters by `&`.

When using POST, path must be specified as for GET method. However,
when using POST, query parameters set by URL can be mixed with the
parameters specified in the posted JSON object in the form:

```json
{
   "variable1": 3,
   "variable2": "value string"
}
```

POSTed JSON object keys are checked first and used, if specified,
ignoring the query settings specified in URL.

In the description of the schema below, GET form is used, unless
specified differently.


## Examples

See `examples` folder for the example queries and their
results. Below, just the results are referenced. For corresponding
queries, see accompanying [README](examples/README.md).


## Raster tiles

The server component for providing raster tiles operates using OSM convention
with small extensions. URL is

`http://localhost:8553/v1/tile?style={style}&daylight={dlight}&shift={shift}&scale={scale}&z={z}&x={x}&y={y}`

where

`{style}` - style of the map, set to `default` if not specified

`{dlight}` - either 0 for night or 1 for day

`{shift}` - allows to change used {z} by increasing it to {z}+{shift}

`{scale}` - size of a tile in pixels is {scale}*256

`{z}`, `{x}`, and `{y}` are as in http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames .

Addition of `{scale}` and `{shift}` allows to experiment with
different tile sizes to optimize for performance and human-map
interaction. Note that `shift` is ignored in Mapnik backend. See Poor
Maps settings for example.

At present, only Mapnik backend supports different styles. When using
libosmscout backend, `styles` parameter is ignored.


## Mapbox GL vector tiles

The vector tiles, associated styles, fonts, and icons are provided
via server.

### Styles, sprite

For requesting styles, use

`http://localhost:8553/v1/mbgl/style?style={style}`

where `{style}` is a style name.

Fonts (glyphs) are provided via

`http://localhost:8553/v1/mbgl/glyphs?stack={fontstack}&range={range}`

where

`{fontstack}` - requested font stack, for example `Noto Sans`

`{range}` - requested range, for example `0-255`.

In the styles, corresponding setting for glyphs is
`http://localhost:8553/v1/mbgl/glyphs?stack={fontstack}&range={range}`.

The styles can use provided sprite with icons by specifying
`http://localhost:8553/v1/mbgl/sprite` as a corresponding URL in style
definition.

### Tiles

Tiles are usually assessed through styles. If you want to design a new
style, for requesting tiles, use

`http://localhost:8553/v1/mbgl/tile?z={z}&x={x}&y={y}`

where

`{z}`, `{x}`, and `{y}` are as in
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames .



## Location search

There are two versions of the location search query results. The only
difference is in returned JSON format with the second version, in
addition to returning the results, giving feedback on query parsing to
the user.

### Location search: version 1

The location search is accessed by the following URL:

`http://localhost:8553/v1/search?limit={limit}&search={query}`

where

`{limit}` - maximal number of search results

`{query}` - location and free text search

Results are returned in JSON format ([example](examples/search_v1.json)).

### Location search: version 2

The location search is accessed by the following URL:

`http://localhost:8553/v2/search?limit={limit}&search={query}`

where meaning of the query parameters is the same as for the version
one. However, the result includes parsing feedback when geocoder-nlp
is used, see [example](examples/search_v2.json).


## List of available POI types

List of available POI types is available via

`http://localhost:8553/v1/poi_types`

The list is given as JSON array. When using geocoder-nlp as a search
backend, the list represents currently used aliases for the used tags.
Shortened version of the response is given as an
[example](examples/poi_types.json).


## POI search near a reference position or route

To find POIs within a given radius from a specified reference position
and/or reference route, server can be accessed via `/v1/guide` path:

`http://localhost:8553/v1/guide?radius={radius}&limit={limit}&poitype={poitype}&name={name}&search={search}&lng={lng}&lat={lat}`

where

`{limit}` - maximal number of search results

`{radius}` - distance from the reference in meters

`{poitype}` - POI type name

`{name}` - Name of POI to search

`{search}` - a query that is run to find a reference point, the first result is used

`{lng}`, `{lat}` - longitude and latidude, respectively.

The reference route can be given only through POST JSON object in the form

```json
{
  "route_lng": [longitude1, longitude2, longitude3, ...],
  "route_lat": [latitude1, latitude2, latitude3, ...]
}
```

Given POI type is considered either as an alias or imported POI
type. Type comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner. POI types
are formed from OSM tags in the form `tag_value`.

List of the current tags and aliases, as used by geocoder-nlp, is given at
[https://rinigus.github.io/osmscout-server/tags](https://rinigus.github.io/osmscout-server/tags).

In addition, POI can be searched by its name. For example, you could
search for the restaurant by its name. This parameter is only
supported by Geocoder-NLP backend.

It is required, that either POI type, POI name, or the type and name
are specified in the query.

The reference point can be given either as a query ("Paris") or as a
location coordinates. If the both forms are given in URL, location
coordinates are preferred.

When reference route is given, the search is performed along the
route. It can be used to find POIs along the whole route or its
fraction. To search along a fraction of the reference route, the route
has to be specified as well as the reference point (via `search` or
the pair of `lng`, `lat`). With the reference point specified, the
fraction is determined by finding the closest section of the route to
the reference point and starting search from that section. Such search
for a fraction of the route allows to specify the full route and the
current position to find all POIs of interest along the remaining
route, for example.

Search along the route is performed from its start (full route or
fraction) and until either the number of POIs has reached the `limit`
or the full route has been searched along. The `distance` returned for
each POI is in this form of the search as the distance along the route
till the point of the first section satisfying the specified `radius`
to the object. As such, the returned `distance` can be not till the
closest section of the route nor it takes into account the underlying
route network required to reach POI when moving along the
route. However, it should give a reasonable estimate for the distance
in question.

The result is given in JSON format. It returns a JSON object with two
keys: `"origin"` (coordinates of the reference point used in the
search) and `"results"` (array with the POIs). See
[example](examples/guide.json) for details.


## Routing

The current protocol (version 2) is fully used by Valhalla's backend
and is Valhalla's API for `route` call. In part, version 2 is
supported, by libosmscout as well. Version 1 (`v1/route`) is used by
libosmscout and is described in [OLD_API](README.older_api.md).


### Version 2: Valhalla

Routing instructions calculations are only one of the several Valhalla
APIs that are exposed by OSM Scout Server. For description of the URL
schema, as used by Valhalla's backend, see below in a separate
section. Valhalla is a recommended backend for routing and it is
expected that the most of the users will be using it.

This is the version that would be mainly supported in future. It uses
Valhalla's API, as described in
https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla-docs/blob/master/turn-by-turn/api-reference.md
. Please note that there is no API key in the Valhalla's component
used by OSM Scout Server.

At present, all calls via `v2/route`, as
`http://localhost:8553/v2/route?...` would equivalent to Valhalla
via `/route?...`.


### Version 2: libosmscout

When using libosmscout as a backend, version 2 can be used to request
the routes. In this case, the server would consider limited subset of
Valhalla's API. In particular, `costing` option would be used to
select the transportation mode (`auto`, `bicycle`, or `pedestrian`)
with the order of points found from `location`. The reply of the
server will follow Version 1 protocol with an additional flag `API version`
set to `libosmscout V1` in the response of the server. Using
this flag, the client application can determine whether version 1
protocol response has been used.


## Valhalla API for routing, map matching, and other services

Valhalla is interfaced by OSM Scout Server through Valhalla's C++ API
and it exposes most of Valhalla's functionality via different path
components of the URL.

URL schema for Valhalla's APIs is in the form

`http://localhost:8553/v2/{api_name}?json={json}`

where

`{api_name}` - name of the used API, as specified below

`{json}` - JSON query, as specified by the corresponding Valhalla's API.

OSM Scout Server does not impose any API key to the Valhalla's
calls. The following Valhalla's APIs are supported (with the link given describing the API):

* `route` - [routing instructions](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/blob/master/docs/api/turn-by-turn/api-reference.md)

* `trace_attributes` - [map matching, trace attributes](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/blob/master/docs/api/map-matching/api-reference.md),
  for obtaining road attributes as a result of matching the coordinate sequence, as fed from GPS device, with the road network.
  Can be used for just in time navigation information.

* `trace_route` - [map matching, trace_route](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/blob/master/docs/api/map-matching/api-reference.md),
  for creating navigation instructions on the basis of coordinate sequence. Can be used to share the used road.

* `locate` - [information about streets and intersections](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/blob/master/docs/api/locate/api-reference.md)

* `matrix` - [time-distance matrix](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/blob/master/docs/api/matrix/api-reference.md)

* `optimized_route` - [optimized route between set of locations](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/blob/master/docs/api/optimized/api-reference.md)

* `isochrone` - [reachability from a given point within a time limit](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/blob/master/docs/api/isochrone/api-reference.md)

* `height` - [elevation data for a single location or a path](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/blob/master/docs/api/elevation/api-reference.md)

At the moment of writing (Jul 2018), elevation data is not imported in the distributed maps. The corresponding issue has been
opened (https://github.com/rinigus/osmscout-server/issues/244).


## Activation URL

When its needed to start the server that has been configured for
autostarting using systemd socket activation, there is a convenience
access path that will not trigger any error or further action

`http://localhost:8553/v1/activate`

When successful, it will return `{ "status": "active" }` as a
response.


## D-Bus API

D-Bus API is provided via service `org.osm.scout.server1`. At present,
its used to provide map matching service for just in time navigation
information. In future, D-Bus API can be extended on request.

### Root

At path `/org/osm/scout/server1`, interface `org.osm.scout.server1`,
currently the following is supported:

**`Url`** string property with the URL base that can be used to
generate url's for access via HTTP API. For example, by default, its
`http://127.0.0.1:8553`.

There is also an API for D-Bus activation on at the root location. 

### Map matching via D-Bus

D-Bus API is available only if Valhalla router is used, as configured
by default.

For QML applications, there is a reference implementation that uses
map matching API to provide just in time information. The
implementation is available as a [QML
PositionSourceMapMatched](https://github.com/rinigus/positionsource-mapmatched-qml)
type and can be easily incorporated into application without
consulting OSM Scout Server API.

Map matching is provided at path
`/org/osm/scout/server1/mapmatching1`, interface
`org.osm.scout.server1.mapmatching1`. On presence of the service,
there is a boolean property `Active` which equals to `True`.

The main interaction with the server occurs via the following method:

* **`Update`**`(int32 mode, Double latitude, Double longitude, Double
  accuracy) -> String`.  This is a method that should be called for
  updating the current location, given by coordinates and
  accuracy. Valhalla's map matching cost factor is given by `mode`
  where it can have the following values

  - 1 car, "auto" in Valhalla API
  - 2 car along shorter distance, "auto_shorter" in Valhalla API
  - 3 bicycle
  - 4 bus
  - 5 pedestrian

  By repeatedly calling `Update`, OSM Scout Server builds trajectory
  of the client and analyzes it to provide information regarding the
  current location. The return value is given by JSON object in a
  String form. Note that this object is filled _only_ with the
  properties that have changed when compared to the previous call. For
  example, if the street name is the same as during the last call, it
  is not returned in the returned JSON object. The following
  properties are supported:

  - `direction` direction of motion along the matched street or path, in degrees [0,360] from true north;
  - `direction_valid` equals to 1 if reported direction is valid, 0 otherwise;
  - `latitude` matched coordinate;
  - `longitude` matched coordinate;
  - `street_name` matched street name, empty if no data is available or no match was found;
  - `street_speed_assumed` car speed assumed for the matched street section in meters/second, negative if no data or no match was found;
  - `street_speed_limit` car speed limit for the matched street section in meters/second, negative if no data or no match was found.

  On request, more data can be made available, as supported by
  Valhalla `trace_attributes` API.

Map matching is a D-Bus client specific, with each client having
separate session (history of coordinates) for each of the used
modes. Histories of the different clients are kept separately.

For maintaining the history, clients can call

* **`Reset`**`(int32 mode)` drop the history and start a session for
  `mode` as new for the calling client.

* **`Stop`**`(int32 mode)` and **`Stop`**`()` stop session for `mode`
  or all modes for the calling client.

See [QML
PositionSourceMapMatched](https://github.com/rinigus/positionsource-mapmatched-qml)
type for example implementation of the interaction with the server,
including support for automatic start of the server via systemd socket
activation.
